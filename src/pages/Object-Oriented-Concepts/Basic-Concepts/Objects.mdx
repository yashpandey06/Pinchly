## <strong style={{ color: "#ec407a" }}> What are objects ?</strong>
In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit that represents a real-world or conceptual entity. It is a runtime entity that has both state (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions). Essentially, an object is an instance of a class, which defines its structure and behavior.

While an object takes up space and memory, a class does not. A class serves as a blueprint that can be used to create multiple objects.

Object consist of the following things :

<br/>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State:</strong> represents the data (value) of an object.</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> represents the behavior (functionality) of an object.</li>
  <li><strong>Identity:</strong> An object is represented by a unique identifier or you can say ObjectId (in simple terms).</li>
</ul>
