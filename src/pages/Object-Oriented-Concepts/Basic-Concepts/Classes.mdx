In this section, we will learn about classes. In object-oriented programming (OOP), we design programs using objects and classes. Classes are like blueprints for creating objects, which are the building blocks of our programs. This approach makes the code easier to organize and maintain.

<br/>
Classes are blueprints for creating objects, similar to how an architect's blueprint is used to build a house. Just as a blueprint defines the structure, layout, and design of a house, a class defines the structure and behavior of an object.

You can also think of a class as a recipe for creating objects. Like a recipe specifies the ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time, a class specifies the properties and behaviors of the objects it creates.

The advantage of using classes is that they allow you to create objects that behave in a consistent and predictable manner.
