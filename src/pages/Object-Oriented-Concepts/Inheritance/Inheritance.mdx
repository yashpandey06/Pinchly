Inheritance in Java allows one object to acquire all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is a crucial aspect of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
By inheriting from an existing class, you can reuse the methods and fields of the parent class. Additionally, you can introduce new methods and fields in your current class.

Inheritance signifies an IS-A relationship, also known as a parent-child relationship.

Consider the example in the picture above: Assume 'Vehicle' as the parent class from which properties are inherited by a specific vehicle. These specific vehicles also have their own properties and behavior implementations.

This promotes code reusability, as we don't have to write the same logic repeatedly.
